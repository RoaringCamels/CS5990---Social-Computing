    """
    Read graph from file and return NetworkX graph object
    
    Time Complexity:
    ---------------
    O(E) where E is the total number of edges in the file
    - First pass: O(E) to count total lines
    - Second pass: O(p*E) where p is the percentage (0 to 1)
    - Graph construction: O(p*E) for adding edges
    Total: O(E) as p â‰¤ 1
    
    Space Complexity:
    ----------------
    O(V + p*E) where V is number of vertices and E is number of edges
    - O(V) for storing vertices in the graph
    - O(p*E) for storing edges based on percentage read
    - O(1) for other variables (total_lines, current_line, etc.)
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    file_path : str
        Path to the graph file
    percentage : float
        Percentage of data to read (between 0 and 1)
        Default is 1.0 (100% of data)
    
    Returns:
    --------
    NetworkX graph object
    
    Notes:
    ------
    - The method performs two passes over the file:
      1. First pass counts total valid lines (O(E))
      2. Second pass reads selected percentage of edges (O(p*E))
    - Memory usage scales with number of unique vertices and selected edges
    - Graph construction is incremental, adding edges one by one

Performance Analysis:
-------------------
1. File Reading:
   - Two passes through file required
   - First pass: O(E) to count lines
   - Second pass: O(p*E) to read selected edges
   
2. Memory Usage:
   - Graph storage: O(V + p*E)
   - Temporary variables: O(1)
   - No additional data structures needed
   
3. Scalability:
   - Linear with file size for time complexity
   - Memory scales with unique vertices and selected edges
   - Percentage parameter allows memory-constrained processing
   
4. Bottlenecks:
   - File I/O operations (two passes required)
   - Graph construction (adding edges one by one)
   
5. Optimization Notes:
   - Could be optimized for very large files by:
     * Using single pass with reservoir sampling
     * Batch processing of edges
     * Memory-mapped file reading
